# üß† Advanced Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques

Welcome to the repository for **"An Experimental Study on Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques."** This project explores cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning methodologies to enhance the detection and classification of brain tumors.

## üìú Abstract

The increasing incidence of brain tumors highlights an urgent need for precise diagnostic methods. This study introduces an innovative convolutional model to improve brain tumor identification accuracy. Using **Inception V3**, **GoogLeNet**, and **VGG-19** models, we meticulously evaluate each model‚Äôs performance in classifying brain tumor images, achieving remarkable results:

- **Inception V3:** 98.25% accuracy
- **GoogLeNet:** 95.36% accuracy
- **VGG-19:** 91.24% accuracy

Our novel approach utilizes **decision-level fusion** to combine outputs from multiple models, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our detection system by leveraging the unique strengths of each model.

## üåü Key Features

- **Transfer Learning Techniques:** Leverages pre-trained models to improve performance.
- **Fusion-Based Approach:** Decision-level fusion aggregates diverse outputs for reliable tumor classification.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** Incorporates Otsu Thresholding and CLAHE to improve image quality and classification precision.
